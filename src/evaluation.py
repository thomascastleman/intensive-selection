Used to evaluate the solutions generated by different algs

Give stats like:
	- percentage of students with each choice (first, second ...)
	- percentage of students paired with none of their choices

	- for each grade, percentage of students with first choice

	- percentage full for each intensive (num students assigned / max capacity)
